                    I am an <i>Unity3D</i> developer currently looking for a job,
                    preferably in game development, or interactive applications and experiences.
                    My main areas of work are gameplay and UI programing.

                    <br />

                    I have worked developing <i>Serious Games</i> that were used for cognitive training and
                    rehabilitation, and more recently, developing an application for indoors navigation.
